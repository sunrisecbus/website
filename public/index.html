        <h1 id="what-we-do">What we do</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Sunrise Columbus Ohio Hub üòÅ. We are a youth-led advocacy group dedicated to pushing for environmental justice in our communities. We work to inspire rapid radical change through mutual aid, art, direct action, and other tactics. And while we do it, we are working to foster an intersectional, accessible, critical, and caring community. We are currently focused on writing a multimedia zine about community, self-care, and radicalism to refocus the hub after a much-needed break this last summer.
The hub is open to everyone younger than 35 and we are always happy to welcome new members. For instructions to join, please read <a href="#joining-the-hub">Joining the Hub</a>.
If you‚Äôre over 35 please check out the <a href="#supporting-the-hub-as-an-elder">Supporting the Hub as an Elder</a> section.</p>
