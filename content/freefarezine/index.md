# Sunrise Columbus TRANSIT Zine 

Checkout our second ever zine titled “The Argument for Free Fares”, part of our 2022 campaign for Transit Justice in Columbus! 
We did months of research about the benefits of a city with free bus fares, and we firmly believe the environment and community would benefit. 
And we know COTA has the funding to pull it off.
