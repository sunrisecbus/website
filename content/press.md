Columbus Free Press - [Columbus announces ambitious Climate Action Plan that cuts carbon emissions 45% by 2030](https://columbusfreepress.com/article/columbus-announces-ambitious-climate-action-plan-cuts-carbon-emissions-45-2030)
>City leaders repeatedly attributed the increases in ambition for its climate and equity goals to advocacy by a coalition of environmental groups including Ready for 100 Columbus, Sunrise Columbus, Green Columbus, Simply Living, and Columbus Stand Up!
>The initial draft of the Climate Action Plan, released in November 2020, called for reducing Columbus emissions only 25% by 2030. The coalition called for and got a city council hearing at which 30 people testified asking for more ambitious goals in most areas of the plan.

>A coalition of environmental groups including Ready for 100 Columbus, Sunrise Columbus, Green Columbus, and Simply Living asked for and got a city council hearing at which 30 people testified calling for more ambitious goals in the plan's first draft.
>When the second draft was released, with a goal for reducing carbon emissions 36% by 2030, we posted a sign-on letter calling for additional increases in ambition to achieve a 45% emissions reduction. Over 100 people representing 27 organizations co-signed the letter.
>Now, after months of dialogue with Sustainable Columbus, we are elated to see a final CAP that sets a goal of reducing the city's emissions to 45% by 2030 --- putting us well on the path to net zero emissions by 2050. With this plan, Columbus will be doing its part to reduce global emissions --- even more than the weak goals set by world leaders at the recent COP 26.

>There are many organizations working to quickly transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Trade Unions for Energy Democracy and the Labor Network for Sustainability are two of the main labor-related forums. The Sunrise Movement and hundreds of other community- and state-based climate justice organizations are making headway by targeting politicians and polluters.

>As dozens of cars buzzed along the downtown stretch of High Street, around 60 people gathered Saturday afternoon at the Ohio Statehouse to rally, march, chant, sing and advocate for more-accessible and eco-friendly public transit in the city and state.
>Organized by the Columbus hub of the Sunrise Movement, the "Columbus Rally for Public Transit and a Green Future" started and ended at the Statehouse with a march to Battelle Riverfront Park and U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown's downtown office sandwiched in between.

>On Saturday, July 17th over 100 Ohioans in Columbus and Cincinnati rallied to demand that Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) back legislation to increase public transit service across the country. Participants, including members of youth-led climate organization Sunrise Movement and Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 1, called on Senator Brown to support the "Stronger Communities Through Better Transit Act." The bill would provide $20 billion per year in federal funding for transit operations.

>Public transportation should be cleaner, more available and, if possible, free. That was the message Wednesday when members of the youth organization Sunrise Oberlin and like-minded groups delivered more than 100 letters to the Cleveland office of U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown.
